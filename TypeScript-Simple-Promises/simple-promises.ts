// Understanding Promises
// Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations.
// They represent a value that may be available now,
// or in the future, or never.

// Key Concepts:

// Pending: Initial state
// Fulfilled: Operation completed successfully = resolved
// Rejected: Operation failed = rejected

// Basic syntax: const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {})

console.log("one");

console.log("two");

const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

    const isResolved = true;

    if (isResolved) {

        // This value will be resolved and available in .then method
        resolve('three');

    } else {

        // This value will be rejected and available in .catch method
        reject("error");

    }

}).then((val) => {

    // three will be available here because of we passed resolved value 
    console.log(val);

});


console.log("four");
